            <p>Throughout 
            my learning of front-end frameworks, I will be consistently updating 
            and improving how it was built. The name was inspired by the 2.5D
             dioramas I design and construct out of paper and card. The end goal 
             will be to have a 3D isometric diorama personal portfolio.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I was originally struggling with the colour palette of the website,
                but after scratching my head over it for longer than I'd like to admit,
                I looked over to my stack of tote bags and found the perfect combination.
