            <h1>Inspiration</h1>
            <p>The original inspiration behind his project was to decrease the time
                it took for me to transfer and organise all of the photos and 
                videos that my mum loved to take on her phone, onto her portable
                storage drive; I can't tell you the amount of SD cards she has 
                already completely filled up. It also helps with redundancy, as 
                it helps organise your local backup.
                <br><br>
                Before I created this tool, the reptitive workflow was as follows:
                <ol>
                    <li>Connect phone & portable storage to PC.</li>
                    <li>Begin searching at x point in time, say 2021-05</li>
                    <li>Wait for the search to complete</li>
                    <li>Transfer all found files to portable hard drive (which sometimes took hours)</li>
                    <li>Move on to next month (2021-06) and repeat steps 3-5 until up to date</li>
                </ol>
                <br><br>
                <p>
                    The record was 12 hours for only 3 months of media!!! 
                    <br><br>
                    Now that it exists, the longest part of the process is 
                    transferring all data (without need of specifying months) to the 
                    portable hard drive, and pressing a single button.
                    <h1>Downfalls</h1>
                    <p>This tool works best if you haven't backed up any of your files
                        for a couple of months or years, as if you are simply doing
                        a monthly backup, it is easier to just pop the year/month in 
                        the search bar to drag & drop accordingly.
                        <br><br>
                        The addition of regex to check for dates via file name
                        would be a helpful addition, and furthermore, examining
                        file metadata would be even more beneficial to the 
                        improvement of this tool.
